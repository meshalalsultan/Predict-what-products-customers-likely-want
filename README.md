# Predict What Products Customers Likely Want

Predict what products customers likely want using machine learning and then optimize a targeted campaign using advanced decision optimization in a Jupyter notebook.

# Predict customer interest to optimize a campaign with ML + DO
This project has a Jupyter notebook written in Python named Promote financial products to bank customers that first analyzes data from the known\_behaviors.csv and unknown\_behaviors.csv data sets to understand and visualize past customer behavior.

Next, the notebook trains a machine learning model to predict which customers would be likely to buy which product in the new year, and visualizes these predictions. Then the notebook defines a decision optimization model and solves it for the input data, which includes the predictions from the ML model. The DO model determines the optimal marketing campaign actions of which customers to offer which products to achieve the optimal results, given the constraints.
# Predict What Products Customers Likely Want

## Overview
This project combines machine learning and decision optimization to predict customer preferences for financial products and optimizes marketing campaigns accordingly. Using Jupyter notebooks, it processes behavioral data to forecast interests and devise strategic marketing actions.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predict customer preferences based on historical behavior.
- **Decision Optimization**: Optimize marketing strategies to maximize engagement and profitability.

## Project Structure
- **predict coustomer like - P4 notebook.ipynb**: Main Jupyter notebook implementing the ML and DO models.
- **Social_Network_Ads.csv**: Sample data for social network advertising.
- **known_behaviors.csv**: Historical data of customer behaviors.
- **unknown_behaviors.csv**: Data set with potential customer behaviors for prediction.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meshalalsultan/Predict-what-products-customers-likely-want.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the notebook**:
    Open the Jupyter notebook and run all cells to see the model in action.

## How It Works
The notebook analyzes known and unknown behavior data to predict customer product preferences. It then applies decision optimization to determine the most effective marketing strategies under given constraints.
